          Traditional Hiring is Broken

            Job applications often result in hundreds, if not thousands, of
            candidates, making it nearly impossible to screen and interview each one
            effectively. Sorting through resumes and conducting countless
            interviews can overwhelm even the most experienced hiring teams. As a
            result, many qualified candidates are overlooked, and the hiring
            process becomes slow and inefficient.

            For job seekers, the competition is fierce, and standing out without a
            way to effectively showcase their real-world skills is a major
            barrier. Resumes and job histories don't always reflect the practical
            knowledge and abilities needed for the role, leading to missed
            opportunities and frustration.
